## Not Yet

A visual anti-alarm Android app.

It's a quick and dirty little app that aims to help with the situation where you tell a small child that some thing will happen
or is allowed at such-and-such time (like waking up their parents, or watching TV), and they can't read a clock yet (or pretend to
not know). 

Set a target time and press "start", and you get an analog clock whose background starts out red (or whatever color you want), that
also shows the target time as ghost hands. When the target time is reached, the ghost hands disappear, the background switches
to green (or whatever color you chose). You can set a "we're getting close" duration and color, so that e.g. 5 minutes before the
target time, the clock background turns e.g. yellow.

The clock activity is configured to keep the screen on and launch over the lock screen (so that switching the screen off and on
again has the clock visible.) Pressing back locks the phone, if you allow the required admin access (the app will guide you there).
You'll probably want to either pin the app after starting the clock, or keep your eyes on things until the keyguard kicks in under
the clock, so that the children won't just press the home button and start watching internet videos.
